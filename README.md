## Testing and Coverage

We have written unit tests for all critical features of the application, ensuring over 95% code coverage. The tests cover various functionalities, including cart operations, order creation, and table management. Each test case is designed to validate specific behaviors and ensure the application behaves as expected.

### How to Run Tests

To run the tests, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

This command will discover and execute all test cases defined in your Django application. 

### Key Test Cases

1. Cart Functionality:
    - 'Initialization': Tests if the cart initializes correctly.
   - 'Adding Products': Verifies that products can be added to the cart.
   - 'Removing Products': Checks that products can be removed from the cart.
   - 'Updating Quantity': Ensures that the quantity of products in the cart can be updated.

3. Order Creation:
   - 'GET Request': Tests the order creation view to ensure it renders correctly.
   - 'POST Request': Validates the order creation process and checks for successful redirection.

4. Table Management:
   - 'Creating Tables': Tests the table creation view to ensure that new tables can be added correctly.



## Agile Workflow
